            <h1>What is Ys?</h1>
            <p class="column">Ys is a video game series created by Japanese developer <a href="https://www.falcom.co.jp/" alt="Nihon Falcom Corporation" target="_blank">Nihon Falcom Corporation</a> and is widely considered the <em>Godfather of Japanese Role Playing Games</em>. It stands on a well-aged and respected pedestal along with <strong>Dragon Quest</strong> (Father of JRPGs) and <strong>Final Fantasy</strong> as one of the pioneering video games for the role-playing genre, circa 1987. It also pre-dates <strong>Final Fantasy</strong> by a few months in Japan. <strong>Final Fantasy</strong> went mainstream, and <strong>Dragon Quest</strong> is catching up, but Ys is still considered one of the most niche JRPGs to this very day. There are currently 8 canonical games in the series officially localized in English, mostly available on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/" alt="PlayStation" target="_blank">PlayStation</a> platforms and PC. Unlike games like <strong>Final Fantasy</strong> and <strong>The Legend of Zelda</strong>, the Ys series follows the adventures of a single character, a boy named Adol as he grows up. Many of the Ys games have been remade and remastered several times. To fully appreciate the series, we recommend playing the most recent versions of each game, which have officially replaced all previous versions rendering past iterations obsolete. However, the older games do have historical relevance and are enjoyable as is.</p>

            <h2>What Makes Ys So Appealing?</h2>
            <p>Ys is a series that rewards players with its fantastic lore and action-packed gameplay. Battles are in real time (not turn-based) and are incredibly fast-paced. What sets Ys apart from other video games is the attention to detail in every aspect of game development. The games are never rushed to meet a deadline and take months to polish (something that is severely lacking in most of modern gaming development). Ever since <a href="https://www.falcom.co.jp/" alt="Nihon Falcom Corporation" target="_blank">Nihon Falcom</a> created the series back in 1987, they've poured every ounce of their energy into its music, story, graphics, art, design and gameplay. Unlike other games, there is not just one or two titles within the series that are praised above all others. Each Ys game is incredibly robust and is favourited across the board by thousands of fans around the world. It all boils down to the contents of Adol's journals and the 4th-wall-breaking storytelling that is consistent throughout the entire series.</p>

            <h2>I'm new to Ys. Where do I start?</h2>
            <p>We highly recommend you begin your journey with the first Ys game. The latest version is included in a bundle pack called Ys I & II Chronicles. Though each Ys game is technically developed with a self-contained story, Falcom has developed this 30-year-old series with a deep lore that is gradually explained in a very specific order. A player can choose to enter the Ys series in any order, but this decision would ultimately lead to that person either liking the series or absolutely loving it.</p>

            <h2>Why is I & II kicking my ass?</h2>
            <p>Ys I & II Chronicles is a remake of games that originally released in 1987. The graphics, music and overall presentation have been modernized for current HD standards, but the gameplay remains true to its source material. Some players might enter this franchise with a retrospective comparison to other games such as <strong>Dragon Quest</strong>, <strong>Final Fantasy</strong> or <strong>The Legend of Zelda</strong>. Remember, these games began in a time of untapped experimentation. Nowadays, developers try to either revise old systems or make novel gameplay just to be different from the past. You need to be smart when playing the original Ys games. They will not hold your hand. Here are a few spoiler-free tips to get you started.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Save the moment you are able to control Adol. Remember, you can save at any time.</li>
                <li>When Adol begins his adventure, he is tasked to go to the next town. Speak to every NPC and learn as much story as you can. One NPC warns Adol that if he is not confident in battle, avoid it at all costs until he is prepared. Unlike modern games, do not immediately engage in battle. Try not to pull a "Leeroy Jenkins", please. Remember, this is a game from 1987. Play smart. Travel cautiously to the second town.</li>
                <li>When not in a dungeon your life will gradually heal when resting (standing still).</li>
                <li>If the first boss is giving you trouble, question the genre of game you are playing. What do players do when they are under-leveled?</li>
                <li>If Adol cannot pass a door, think of the people he's met. It might be useful to have a pen and paper to make notes on your current goals. Players did this 30 years ago. It is, unfortunately, a forgotten art in gaming. Some NPCs are worth re-visiting, especially if they are knowledgeable of Adol's current situation.</li>
                <li>Before facing the final boss, reflect on previous tasks that got you this far. The game is not simply "defeat the final boss". Observe everything in your menu and think about the story. You know the path Adol has taken this entire time. What has the antagonist been up to?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>It is also important to know that in the most recent versions of Ys I, Adol has a level cap of 10 because of the story. Ys I is split into two major parts. The goal of the first half of the game is for Adol to become a confident fighter. If Adol is not at level 10 by the time he begins the second half of the game, he is not ready. Every Ys game beyond Ys I has a level cap of 50+.</p>

                <p>The gameplay will be unaffected either way you choose, but having an understanding of lore separates those who like the series and those who love it:</p>

                </ol>

                <p>The Story Path will gradually introduce you to the lore as you progress through the series. Sit back and enjoy as the tale unfolds. You will understand all references, world building and character relations with this route. The story of Ys VIII is the most removed from the rest of the series and makes slight references to previous games. Feel free to play it before Ys VI The Ark of Napishtim or after Ys Seven.</p>
